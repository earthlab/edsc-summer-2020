    "## About Vector Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector data are composed of discrete geometric locations (x, y values) known as **vertices** that define the \"shape\" of the spatial object. The organization of the vertices determines the type of vector that you are working \n",
    "with. There are three types of vector data: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Points:** Each individual point is defined by a single x, y coordinate. There can be many points in a vector point file. Examples of point data include: sampling locations, the location of individual trees or the location of plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lines:** Lines are composed of many (at least 2) vertices, or points, that are connected. For instance, a road or a stream may be represented by a line. This line is composed of a series of segments, each \"bend\" in the road or stream represents a vertex that has defined `x, y` location.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Polygons:** A polygon consists of 3 or more vertices that are connected and \"closed\". Thus the outlines of plot boundaries, lakes, oceans, and states or countries are often represented by polygons. Occasionally, a polygon can have a hole in the middle of it (like a doughnut), this is something to be aware of but not an issue you will deal with in this tutorial.\n",

    "<i class=\"fa fa-star\"></i> **Data Tip:** Sometimes, boundary layers such as states and countries, are stored as lines rather than polygons. However, these boundaries, when represented as a line, will not create a closed object with a defined \"area\" that can be \"filled\".\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shapefiles: Points, Lines, and Polygons\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial data in vector format are often stored in a `shapefile` format. Because the structure of points, lines, and polygons are different, each individual shapefile can only contain one vector type (all points, all lines \n",
    "or all polygons). You will not find a mixture of point, line and polygon objects in a single shapefile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects stored in a shapefile often have a set of associated `attributes` that describe the data. For example, a line shapefile that contains the locations of streams, might contain the associated stream name, stream \"order\" and other \n",
    "information about each stream line object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* More about shapefiles can found on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## One Dataset - Many Files\n",
    "\n",
    "A text file is often self contained. For example, one `.csv` file is composed of one unique file. Many spatial formats are composed of several files. A shapefile is created by 3 or more files, all of which must retain the same NAME and be\n",
    "stored in the same file directory, in order for you to be able to work with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shapefile Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 key files associated with any and all shapefiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`.shp`:** the file that contains the geometry for all features.\n",
    "* **`.shx`:** the file that indexes the geometry.\n",
    "* **`.dbf`:** the file that stores feature attributes in a tabular format.\n",
    "\n",
    "These files need to have the **same name** and to be stored in the same directory (folder) to open properly in a GIS, `R` or **Python** tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, a shapefile will have other associated files including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `.prj`: the file that contains information on projection format including\n",
    "the coordinate system and projection information. It is a plain text file\n",
    "describing the projection using well-known text (WKT) format.\n",
    "* `.sbn` and `.sbx`: the files that are a spatial index of the features.\n",
    "* `.shp.xml`: the file that is the geospatial metadata in XML format, (e.g. ISO 19115 or XML format).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Management - Sharing Shapefiles\n",
    "\n",
    "When you work with a shapefile, you must keep all of the key associated file types together. And when you share a shapefile with a colleague, it is important to zip up all of these files into one package before you send it to\n",
    "them!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import Shapefiles\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the **geopandas** library to work with vector data in **Python**. You will also use `matplotlib.pyplot` to plot your data. "
