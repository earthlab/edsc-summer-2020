    "Raster or “gridded” data are stored as a grid of values which are rendered on a map as pixels. Each pixel value represents an area on the Earth’s surface making the data spatial. A raster file is composed of regular grid of cells, all of which are the same size. You've looked at and used rasters before if you've looked at photographs or imagery in a tool like Google Earth. However, the raster files that you will work with are different from photographs in that they are spatially referenced. Each pixel represents an area of land on the ground. That area is defined by the spatial **resolution** of the raster.\n",

    "## File Formats That Store Raster Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like how vector data has unique file types that store it, raster data is also stored in many ways. The main problem that raster data files have to solve is how to store multiple \"layers\" of imagery. Since satellites will often take images that are meant to be stacked together, i.e. the red, blue, and green images of an area, raster files have to store those images in one of two ways: multiple files, or hierarchical files. \n",

    "Some datasets such as landsat and NAIP are stored in single files. For landsat, often you will find each band stored as a separate .tif file. NAIP stores all bands in on .tif file. Common file types for raster data stored as a single file include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **.tif / .tiff**: Stands for Tagged Image File Format. One of the most common ways to store raster data. How some image satellites, such as Landsat, share their data. \n",
