    "## What Is a Workflow Diagram?\n",
    "\n",
    "A workflow diagram\n",
    "represents a high level overview summary of the steps that you will need to complete \n",
    "to address the question that you are asking in your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example diagram below, you will see a project that has two input \n",
    "datasets that are being used to create an output project. For this example,\n",
    "let's pretend that the output project is a map of areas that are the most \n",
    "vulnerable to drought conditions in your area. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/workflow1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the diagram below imagine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Data:** each green box (Branch #1 and Branch #2) represents the \n",
    "data that you will use to complete your project. Each data set may need to \n",
    "be processed separately at first, prior to beginning your analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cleaning / Processing:** Once you have identified the data that you need to \n",
    "use, you can then import and clean up the data. Cleaning steps may include things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Remove NA or missing data values\n",
    "    * Exploring the data to see if there are any unusual values \n",
    "    * Clipping or filtering out parts off the data that you perhaps don't need for your analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the data cleaning process, you are ready to analyze your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis:** In this step you may manipulate the data to convert it into information \n",
    "that is usable for your analysis. Examples include:\n",
    "    * calculating a vegetation index such as NDVI\n",
    "    * performing classification on your data\n",
    "    * If your data are time series, perhaps this step involves summarizing and calculating statistics on the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output Data:** Finally you might use your analysis to produce an output data set. Following the examples above, example outputs may include:\n",
    "    * a geotiff of NDVI for your region\n",
    "    * a classified raster\n",
    "    * a new .CSV file containing summarized time series values\n",
    "  \n",
    "*****\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branch 2 - A Second Input Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps above outlined the initial processing for a single dataset. But maybe your project will require\n",
    "more than one dataset. For example if you are working with remote sensing imagery, maybe there are \n",
    "vector boundaries (study area boundaries, county boundaries, etc) that you need to complete your final analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to start the same process of opening, exploring and cleaning up that second dataset, prior to \n",
    "completing your final analysis. For instance, you may open up the vector data and discourse that is it \n",
    "in a different Coordinate Reference System than your imagery. You may need to clean up the data and \n",
    "reproject the data first, before trying to work with the two datasets together.\n"

But if you were looking at recovery of a forested area from a small fire that happened last year, you would need a much higher spatial and temporal resolution. Sometimes, even if you find data that is technically correct for your project, it is still not useful for due to resolution limitations.\n",
    "* Specify data sources (e.g. public data portals like Earth Explorer, data from project partners). Once you know more specifically what type of data you are searching for, start identifying data sources that are appropriate for your project. Often, data can be collected from large publically available datsets, but not always. Because of this, it's important to ask:\n",
    "    * Are there datasets that you need but don't have yet? If you are collecting more specialized data, make sure your in contact with the agency you're collecting the data from.
