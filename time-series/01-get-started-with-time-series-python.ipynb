    "* Use the `datetime` object to create easier-to-read time series plots and work with data across various timeframes (e.g. daily, monthly, yearly) in **Python**.\n",

    "Dates can be tricky in any programming language. While you may \n",
    "see a date in a dataset and recognize it as something that can \n",
    "be quantified and related to time, a computer reads in numbers \n",
    "and characters. Often by default, date information is loaded \n",
    "as a string (i.e. a set of characters), rather than something \n",
    "that has an order in time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Python** `datetime` object will make working with and plotting \n",

    "columns containing dates and times as strings into `datetime` objects.\n",
