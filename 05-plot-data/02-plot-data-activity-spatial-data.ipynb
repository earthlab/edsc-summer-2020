You've used a combination of multiple libraries to plot data, including **pandas**, **geopandas**, **matplotlib**, **earthpy**, and various others. This challenge will challenge you to use the appropriate packages and tools to plot each type of data that have been covered so far. First, you will plot out various forms of vector data, then raster data, and finally you will plot a combination of the raster and vector data. \n",

    "\n",
    "To make this plot, do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read in the trails, trailsheads and ranger zones data for the Rocky Mountain National Park trails and the National Parks Service boundaries. The code to open the data is in the cell below for you to run.\n",
    "2. Create a new GeoDataFrame that only contains the South Zone of the RMNP ranger zones `ranger_zones[ranger_zones[\"SUBDISTRIC\"] == \"SOUTH\"]` data  for the park.\n",
    "3. Change the Coordinate Reference System of the boundary dataset to match the trails dataset. To get the Coordinate Reference System of the trails dataset, you can use `trails_dataframe_name.crs`. To set it to the boundary dataset, you can use the `to_crs()` function like so: `boundary_dataframe_name.to_crs(trails_dataframe_name.crs)`\n",
    "4. Plot the trails data and the trailheads data together in a map. \n",
    "5. Add the polygon boundary of the South Ranger zone to the map. \n",
    "6. Change the symbology for the lines and points on the map. For lines, you will change the `linestyle=` argument [options for this argument here](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/linestyles.html) and for points you will modify the `marker=` arguement [options for this argument here](https://matplotlib.org/api/markers_api.html).\n",
    "7. We want a legend for this map, to show the symbology of trails and trail heads. To create this, in the plotting functions for your GeoDataFrames, add an argument `label=` and set it to what you want to call the trails and trailheads on your maps. Also, make sure you have the following lines of code in your plot. It will grab the labels you set in the plot functions and add them to the legend. \n",

This is another way to give your data a background to give it context, besides using elevation or imagery data. Notice you can zoom in/out and move around the map by clicking and dragging. However, there are some aspects that you can change to make the map better! Here are some improvements you can give to the map: \n",

There's a list of [usable icons here](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery). Note: Not all of the icons on that site will work, so if you pick one and it doesn't display try a different option!\n",
