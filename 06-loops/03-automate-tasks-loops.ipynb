    "This is a specific requirement of this function, as `et.data.get_data(url)` will result in an error that `url` is not a valid key for a dataset in **earthpy** (see more details in the\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall that by default, **earthpy** downloads files to a subdirectory called `earthpy-downloads` under the `data` directory in the `earth-analytics` directory (e.g. `earth-analytics/data/earthpy-downloads/`).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this knowledge, you can define a path to this directory and provide that path to the function `os.listdir()` to list out the contents of that directory. \n",
