    "lists include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They are mutable, which means that they can be changed or updated.\n",
    "* **Python** lists can store different types of objects and different data types. So, for example a list can contain a mix of `int`, `float` and `str` values. A list can also contain sublists, arrays and other **Python** data structures.  \n",

    "### Items Within a Python List Can Be Subsetted Using an Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Each value in a list is called an item. Since lists are sequences of items \n",
    "in a specified order, there is a label for the location or order number of \n",
    "each item in the list. This order label is referred to as an index. Indexing \n",
    "allows lists to be iterable, meaning that you can access each item in the list, \n",

    "### About List Indices in Python\n",

    "You can use an index value in **Python** to access objects within lists, to \n",
    "organize data and to manage the order of the items within the data structure. \n",
    "By default, **Python** indexing will always begin at `[0]`, rather `[1]`. \n",
    "Thus, the first item in a **Python** list has an index `[0]`, the second item \n",
    "in a list has an index `[1]`, and so on. You can use the index of an item to \n",
